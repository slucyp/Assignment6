# Overview
This is a brief discussion about the solutions to Assignment 6. Basically, the make file concatenates all separate parts of the .txt file into one and then create a .html file.


# The short instructions for the usage of this repo
## Clone the remote repo
```
git clone https://github.com/slucyp/Assignment6.git
cd Assignment6
make

```
## git commnds
I use `git init` to create an empty repository, then I use `git add filename` to add files that are ingredients or targets for the makefile, as well as the makefile itself. After that, I use `git commit` to commit all the files.To make a remot repo on github for the Assignment 6 files and push all the files in my local git repo tothe github remote repository, I use the following git commands:

```
git remote add origin "http://github.com/slucyp/Assignment6.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```
